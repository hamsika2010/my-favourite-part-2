                    My favourite hobby is singing and listening to music.While I listen to music, I feel relax and calm. Singing is an excellent way of entertainment.I like to sing because it is fun to sing. I also like to sing because I like to sing with my friends. Singing gives me a great pleasure. It helps me to forget my daily problems. Every person has his own favourite groups or singers. My favourite singers are Michael Jackson and Akcent.
                    I like to sing very much. I like music. I want to become a good singer. I am working very hard to achieve my goal. I hope one day I will become a great singer.
